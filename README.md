# image_cutter

This repository hosts a minimal static site served via GitHub Pages. It is a website where you can cut images.

GitHub Pages is already enabled for the `main` branch using the `/ (root)` folder, so `index.html` is served as the site homepage.

You can visit the live site at [https://kotabrog.github.io/image_cutter/](https://kotabrog.github.io/image_cutter/).
