This repository hosts a minimal static site served via GitHub Pages.

GitHub Pages is already enabled for the `main` branch using the `/ (root)` folder, so `index.html` is served as the site homepage.

You can visit the site at [https://kotabrog.github.io/image_cutter/](https://kotabrog.github.io/image_cutter/).
